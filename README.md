This repository demonstrates a Python code snippet that showcases an uncommon error stemming from exception handling.  The `function_with_uncommon_error` function handles both `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions. While seemingly straightforward, the code's behavior can be surprising due to the implicit return of `None` in the `except` blocks. This can lead to unexpected results if the function's return value is not properly checked. The solution showcases best practices to handle such exceptions effectively and improve code clarity.
